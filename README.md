Tips and tricks
===============

'Stop work' button. Helper will automatically update it's state and will
continue to tick from specified value.

* `Ctrl+S` can be used as shortcut to start or stop work on issue. Shortcut
will also work in Agile/Kanban mode.

* You can create filter to show what issues are currently in progress by you
using JQL `labels in (jwh:<your-username-here>:in-work)`.

* You can create filter to show all issues in progress by including condition
`labels in (jwh:in-work)` in your JQL, like this:
![jwh:in-work](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/674812/4696925/679b3904-581d-11e4-9e98-913e51f70cfa.png)


How it's work
=============

Jira Agile Worklog Helper utilizes issue labels for time tracking.

Three labels are used:
* `jwh:in-work` to mark issue in progress by at least one person;
* `jwh:<your-username-here>:in-work` to track down which issues currently in progress;
* `jwh:<your-username-here>:<timestamp>` to track amount of time spent;

Disclamer
=========

Script will automatically track it's installation on the Google Analytics.
It *will not* send any private information about you and your Jira instance.
Tracking will be run only once just after installation and never again.
